# HR-Attrition-Analysis-Tableau
I'm excited to share mTableau project, which explores employee attrition using a range of insightful visualisations. The dashboard highlights key metrics and trends, helping HR teams understand the drivers behind turnover.
 Key Features: 
Total Employee Count, Attrition Rate, and Active Employees for a clear overview.
Custom Donut Chart for analysing attrition by gender within different age groups.
Pie Chart to break down attrition by department.
Heatmap showcasing job satisfaction across various roles.
Column Chart using color intensity to visualize attrition across age groups.
Bar Graph for comparing attrition by educational background.
This project demonstrates how data visualisation can be used to inform HR strategies, reduce turnover, and enhance employee retention efforts.
